Dated: Monday 17th November 2020

    //things that work & dont work (this is a comment in game_beta.luc)
    //1. pointer increase to 10 then game over 
    //2. shifting R0,R1,R2 content and adding based on generated bits
    //3. updating random register from generated random bits
    //4. score & difficulty relationship (hard coded several score inputs)
    //5. (now testing) red,green,blue button input corresponding to pointer (trying with red now first )
    //5.1 correct button input reduces pointer, BUT DOESNT REMOVE Rx bits. (edit in regfile)
